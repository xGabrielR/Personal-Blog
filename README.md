<h3>0.1. What is a Blog ?</h3>
<p>Blog is a simple site where the objective is to share stories, documentaries or any other type of subject divided into posts, each post has a date and a category. For example, a recipe site is a blog where each post is a recipe and throughout the week that same site is updated with new recipes.</p>
